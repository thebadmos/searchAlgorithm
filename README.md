# Searching Algorithms Exercise

For this exercise you must get the tests to pass.

### linearSearch

This function should accept an array and value and return the index at which the value exists or `-1` if the value can not be found. Do **not** use `indexOf` to solve this! This function should use iteration not recursion.

### linearSearchRecursive

If you have not yet implemented this (it is a bonus in the recursion exercise). This function should accept an array and value and return the index at which the value exists or `-1` if the value can not be found. Do **not** use `indexOf` to solve this! This function should use recursion.

### binarySearch

This function should accept an array and value and return the index at which the value exists or `-1` if the value can not be found. Do **not** use `indexOf` to solve this! This function should use iteration not recursion. Make sure that your algorithm runs in _O(log(n))_ and not _O(n)_.
